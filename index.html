		<h1>Summary</h1>
		
		<p>
			Again, as on the preceding day, I had recourse to earthly tactics, and swinging my right fist full upon the point of his chin I followed it with a smashing left to the pit of his stomach.  The effect was marvelous, for, as I lightly sidestepped, after delivering the second blow, he reeled and fell upon the floor doubled up with pain and gasping for wind.  Leaping over his prostrate body, I seized the cudgel and finished the monster before he could regain his feet.

		<h1>Scope of the project</h1>
		
		<p>
			Across the Thames, except just where the boats landed, everything was quiet, in vivid contrast with the Surrey side.  The people who landed there from the boats went tramping off down the lane.  The big ferryboat had just made a journey.  Three or four soldiers stood on the lawn of the inn, staring and jesting at the fugitives, without offering to help.  The inn was closed, as it was now within prohibited hours.
		</p>

		<h2>This is a sample title</h2>

		<p>
			"What's that?" cried a boatman, and "Shut up, you fool!" said a man near me to a yelping dog.  Then the sound came again, this time from the direction of Chertsey, a muffled thud--the sound of a gun.
		</p>

		<p>
			The way led along upon what had once been the embankment of a railroad.  But no train had run upon it for many years. The forest on either side  swelled up the slopes of the embankment and crested across it in a green  wave of trees and bushes. The trail was as narrow as a man's body, and  was no more than a wild-animal runway. Occasionally, a piece of rusty  iron, showing through the forest-mould, advertised that the rail and the  ties still remained. In one place, a ten-inch tree, bursting through at  a connection.
		</p>

		<h2>This is another one</h2>

		<p>
			In the same deathly silence I grasped Dejah Thoris by the hand, and motioning Sola to follow we sped noiselessly from the chamber and to the floor above.  Unseen we reached a rear window and with the straps and leather of my trappings I lowered, first Sola and then Dejah Thoris to the ground below.  Dropping lightly after them I drew them rapidly around the court in the shadows of the buildings, and thus we returned over the same course I had so recently followed from the distant boundary of the city.
		</p>

		<p>
			We finally came upon my thoats in the courtyard where I had left them, and placing the trappings upon them we hastened through the building to the avenue beyond.  Mounting, Sola upon one beast, and Dejah Thoris behind me upon the other, we rode from the city of Thark through the hills to the south.
